Known Bugs:

Axel's sound effects stop playing sometimes. Might be a Ram thing, I'm still looking into it.

During some fights Axel will be missing one of his Chakrams. It is currently unknown why this happens as it doesn't seem to be a ram problem. It will not affect gameplay, but it might look a little strange.

When using reaction commands Axel's model will turn into spaghetti. This is normal for right now and will be fixed in further updates. 


Misc:

The Roxas prologue hasn't been altered. Once you defeat Axel 2 you'll start playing as Axel.

Axel doesn't have any new weapons but you can still equip keyblades onto him in order to get the stats and abilities.

Drive Forms have been removed completely and have been replaced with Hi potions. You can still get growth abilities in the following locations:

High Jump: Defend the Baily with Leon

Quick Run: Escort Queen Minnie *

Dodge Roll: Defeat the Fire/Blizzard lords

Aerial Dodge: Defeat 1k heartless

Glide: Defeat Sephiroth
